# Yaesu 5440 Rotator Controller

This is a stripped-down version of the firmware developed by K3NG and friends.  Much of the capability in K3NG's version has been stripped out to accomodate a smaller device and easier maintanence.  One of these days, I'll add a schematic. THIS IS A BARE-BONE IMPLEMENTATION.

Full documentation for K3NG's version is located [here](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller/wiki).
